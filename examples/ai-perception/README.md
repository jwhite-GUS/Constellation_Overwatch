# AI-Enabled Drone Perception Example

This example demonstrates how to integrate AI capabilities into autonomous drone systems using the Constellation Overwatch SDK.

## Features

- **Computer Vision**: Object detection, image classification, and semantic segmentation
- **Decision Making**: AI-powered mission planning and risk assessment
- **Natural Language Processing**: Command interpretation and response generation
- **Autonomous Operation**: AI-driven autonomous mission execution

## AI Models Used

1. **YOLO Object Detection**: Real-time object detection for situational awareness
2. **Mission Decision Maker**: Rule-based decision making with learning capabilities
3. **Natural Language Interpreter**: Command parsing and response generation

## Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
# Run the AI-enabled drone example
python main.py
```

## AI Capabilities

### Computer Vision
- Real-time object detection (people, vehicles, buildings, obstacles)
- Image classification for scene understanding
- Semantic segmentation for detailed environment analysis

### Decision Making
- Mission-level autonomous decision making
- Risk assessment and safety prioritization
- Multi-objective optimization (safety, efficiency, mission success)

### Natural Language Processing
- Voice command interpretation
- Mission status reporting
- Human-AI interaction interface

## Example Commands

The system can interpret natural language commands such as:
- "Search for people in the area and maintain safe distance"
- "Take off to 50 meters and patrol the perimeter"
- "Return to base if weather conditions deteriorate"

## Configuration

The AI system can be configured through the mission parameters:
- Confidence thresholds for object detection
- Risk tolerance levels for decision making
- Mission objectives and constraints
- Safety parameters and boundaries

## Architecture

The AI-enabled drone system consists of:
1. **Perception Layer**: Computer vision models for environmental understanding
2. **Decision Layer**: AI-powered mission planning and execution
3. **Interface Layer**: Natural language processing for human interaction
4. **Integration Layer**: Seamless integration with the core SDK

This example showcases the power of AI integration in autonomous systems, enabling sophisticated perception, decision making, and human-AI collaboration for complex missions.
