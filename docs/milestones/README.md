## Documentation Reorganization Benefits

This reorganization follows best practices from major open source projects:

### Improved Organization
- **Kubernetes**: Uses structured CHANGELOG directories and clear governance documentation
- **VS Code**: Maintains standardized structure with wiki-based roadmaps
- **Node.js**: Employs standardized community health files and release management
- **React**: Follows clear separation of current status vs. historical records

### Enhanced Accessibility
- **Centralized Status**: All current information in logical locations
- **Professional Standards**: Government-appropriate documentation without decorative elements
- **Clear Navigation**: Intuitive file organization and linking
- **Community Ready**: Standard open source project structure

### Maintainability Improvements
- **Reduced Duplication**: Eliminated redundant status tracking files
- **Clear Responsibility**: Single source of truth for each type of information
- **Version Control**: Proper semantic versioning and change tracking
- **Audit Trail**: Complete decision history and milestone preservation
