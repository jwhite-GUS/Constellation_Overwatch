### Platforms Analyzed
1. **Commercial Edge Computing Systems** - Entity/Task management, mesh networking, local-first architecture
2. **MAVLink Protocol** - Lightweight messaging, 255 system support, extensive language bindings
3. **ArduPilot/Mission Planner** - Parameter management, mission planning, C#/.NET architecture
4. **QGroundControl** - Qt/QML UI, plugin system, cross-platform GCS design
5. **ROS 2 Framework** - Publisher/subscriber, DDS middleware, modular robotics architecture
6. **PX4 Autopilot** - uORB messaging, reactive architecture, flight stack design

## Key Architectural Insights

### Communication Patterns
- **Commercial Systems**: gRPC + REST dual protocol, streaming for high-throughput
- **MAVLink**: 8-14 byte overhead, request/response + streaming hybrid
- **PX4**: uORB publish/subscribe with shared memory, multi-instance topics
- **ROS 2**: DDS-based pub/sub with QoS, service/client, action patterns

### Data Management
- **Entity-Centric**: Industry standard approach to situational awareness
- **Message Versioning**: PX4's forward/backward compatibility strategy
- **Queue Management**: Configurable buffering for critical vs. non-critical data
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Live topic inspection and debugging capabilities

### Integration Strategies
- **Multi-Protocol Gateways**: Supporting diverse vehicle ecosystems
- **Plugin Architectures**: Extensible functionality (QGC/Mission Planner)
- **Mesh Networking**: Edge-first operations with offline capability
- **Security Layers**: Classification handling and audit requirements

## Recommended Architecture for Constellation Overwatch

### Core Design Philosophy
```
Hybrid Multi-Layer Architecture:
├── External Protocols (MAVLink, ROS 2, REST, WebSocket)
├── Protocol Gateways (Translation and routing)
├── Internal Message Bus (Standard patterns with Protocol Buffers)
├── Core Services (Entity, Mission, Vehicle, Sensor, etc.)
├── Plugin Framework (Extensible components)
└── Security Layer (Authentication, authorization, audit)
```

### Key Components
1. **Message Bus Service**: Standard internal communication patterns
2. **Entity Manager**: Industry standard situational awareness patterns
3. **Mission Manager**: Ground control station planning and execution patterns
4. **Vehicle Manager**: Standard autopilot integration
