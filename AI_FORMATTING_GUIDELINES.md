# AI Formatting Guidelines for Constellation Overwatch SDK

<!-- DEVTEAM: This file establishes professional formatting standards for all AI-generated content -->

## Professional Documentation Standards

### General Principles
- **Professional Tone**: Maintain a serious, government-appropriate tone
- **No Decorative Elements**: Avoid emojis, unnecessary icons, or decorative characters
- **Clear Structure**: Use consistent heading hierarchy and formatting
- **Technical Focus**: Emphasize functionality and technical accuracy

### Formatting Rules

#### Headers and Sections
```markdown
# Primary Title
## Major Section
### Subsection
#### Detail Section
```

#### Lists and Bullets
Use standard markdown bullets without decorative elements:
```markdown
- Standard bullet point
- Another item
  - Sub-item
  - Sub-item
```

#### Status Indicators
Instead of emojis, use standard text indicators:
```markdown
- COMPLETE: Feature implementation finished
- IN PROGRESS: Currently under development
- PLANNED: Scheduled for future release
- DEPRECATED: No longer supported
```

#### Code and Technical Content
```markdown
**Code blocks**: Use proper syntax highlighting
`inline code`: Use backticks for inline code references
**File paths**: Use standard path notation without decorative elements
```

#### Professional Alternatives to Common Emojis
- ‚úÖ ‚Üí COMPLETE or [DONE]
- ‚ùå ‚Üí INCOMPLETE or [PENDING]
- üöÄ ‚Üí DEPLOYMENT or LAUNCH
- üìö ‚Üí DOCUMENTATION
- üîß ‚Üí CONFIGURATION or TOOLS
- üéØ ‚Üí OBJECTIVES or GOALS
- üåü ‚Üí FEATURED or IMPORTANT
