# Issues and Decisions Log

**Last Updated**: July 24, 2025  
**Purpose**: Track project issues, architectural decisions, and resolution actions

## Current Issues

### Repository Documentation Consolidation - RESOLVED
**Priority**: HIGH | **Status**: COMPLETED | **Date Resolved**: July 24, 2025

#### Issue Description
The repository contained scattered documentation files tracking completion status, versions, and project milestones. This structure lacked the standardized organization found in major open source projects.

#### Original Documentation Structure (Non-Standard)
- `SDK_COMPLETE.md` - SDK transformation completion status
- `SDK_VERSION.md` - Release notes and version information 
- `PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Current project status overview
- `FUNCTIONAL_CORE_SUCCESS.md` - Success milestone tracking
- `STATUS.md` - Duplicate status information
- `.black_formatting_complete` - Hidden formatting completion marker
- `.ci_improvements_complete` - Hidden CI/CD improvement marker

#### Resolution Actions Taken
1. **Consolidated Documentation Structure**: Created standardized docs organization
2. **Moved Status Files**: Consolidated all status information into `docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md`
3. **Archived Milestones**: Moved completion records to `docs/milestones/` directory
4. **Removed Duplicate Files**: Eliminated redundant status tracking files
5. **Standardized Organization**: Followed best practices from Kubernetes, VS Code, and other major projects

#### New Documentation Structure (Standardized)
```
docs/
├── PROJECT_STATUS.md           # Consolidated project status
├── ISSUES_AND_DECISIONS.md    # This file - decision log
├── development/                # Developer documentation
│   ├── ARCHITECTURE.md        # System architecture overview
│   ├── API_DOCUMENTATION.md   # API references
│   └── TESTING_GUIDE.md       # Testing procedures
├── milestones/                 # Historical achievements
│   ├── SDK_TRANSFORMATION.md  # SDK completion milestone
│   ├── FUNCTIONAL_CORE.md     # Functional core implementation
│   └── AI_INTEGRATION.md      # AI integration milestone
└── setup/                      # Installation and setup guides
    └── development-setup.md    # Development environment setup
```

#### Research-Based Rationale
Major open source projects follow standardized patterns:
- **Kubernetes**: Uses CHANGELOG directory, standardized governance docs, clear separation
- **VS Code**: Standardized structure with wiki-based roadmaps and iteration plans
- **Node.js**: Uses standardized files with release-based versioning
- **React**: Follows standard structure with clear versioning in releases

## Architectural Decisions

### Decision: Functional Core First Approach
**Date**: July 22, 2025  
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED  
**Decision Maker**: Development Team

- **Simulation Container**: `Dockerfile.simulation` for testing and validation
- **ROS Container**: `Dockerfile.ros` for robotics middleware integration
- **Gazebo Container**: `Dockerfile.gazebo` for 3D simulation environments

#### Outcomes
- **Cross-Platform Success**: Confirmed working on Windows and macOS
- **GPU Integration**: AI training functional with NVIDIA hardware
- **Development Efficiency**: Faster onboarding for new developers
- **Consistent Environment**: Eliminates "works on my machine" issues

### Decision: AI-First Architecture
**Date**: July 20, 2025  
**Status**: IMPLEMENTED  
**Decision Maker**: Development Team

#### Context
Needed to determine the role of AI in the autonomous systems architecture - peripheral tool vs core component.

#### Decision
Implemented AI as fundamental to autonomous operations, not an add-on feature.

#### Rationale
- **Mission Requirements**: Autonomous systems require intelligent decision making
- **Competitive Advantage**: AI-first approach differentiates from traditional systems
- **Future-Proofing**: AI capabilities becoming essential for advanced autonomy
- **Government Strategy**: Aligns with government AI initiatives and requirements

#### Implementation
