# Constellation Overwatch SDK

**Government-Owned, Community-Driven Autonomous Systems Integration Platform**

Constellation Overwatch is a modular open systems architecture (MOSA) autonomy and integration stack designed to support distributed command and control of autonomous systems, sensors, and payloads. This SDK provides a common, open-source development environment enabling rapid, secure integration of heterogeneous unmanned systems and payloads into a unified operational picture.

## Project Overview

Constellation Overwatch differentiates itself through its completely open, non-proprietary licensing and ecosystem-driven development model. Leveraging existing government-owned solutions such as the Team Awareness Kit (TAK), this platform enables real-time data fusion, collaborative autonomy, multi-domain sensor integration, and intuitive common operating picture (COP) visualizationâ€”without restrictive per-seat licenses or proprietary integration barriers.

**Functionally analogous to**: Anduril's Lattice, Collins Aerospace's RapidEdge, Boeing's collaborative autonomy systems, and commercial industry Pixhawk standards, but with complete open-source accessibility.

## Key Attributes

### Open Architecture Integration
- Rapid "plug-and-play" capability for any MOSA-compliant autonomous platform, payload, or sensor
- Standardized interfaces and communication protocols
- Hardware-agnostic design supporting diverse unmanned systems

### Continuous ATO & Secure DevSecOps Environment
- Government-owned sandbox for rapid, secure innovation and deployment
- Containerized development environment with security best practices
- Automated testing and continuous integration pipelines

### Collaborative Autonomy & Distributed AI
- Real-time tasking and mission autonomy across diverse unmanned platforms
- Multi-domain sensor fusion and data processing
- Distributed decision-making capabilities with machine learning integration
- Computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning support

### Ecosystem-Driven Development
- Community-contributed capabilities and plugins accelerate adoption
- Modular architecture enabling rapid capability integration
- Reduced development costs through shared resources

### Common Operational Picture (COP) Integration
- Seamless compatibility with existing government COP frameworks (e.g., TAK)
- Real-time data visualization and situational awareness
- Interoperable with existing military command and control systems

## Mission Impact

With new mandates for mass-proliferation of US-made commoditized sUAS, Constellation Overwatch allows government and industry partners to quickly integrate capabilities into operationally relevant scenarios, maximizing innovation and interoperability while eliminating proprietary licensing lock-in. More importantly, it gets UXS tools into the hands of warfighters directly by decentralizing the integration of useful robotics devices into common portable unit-level kits.

## Architecture

- **ROS 2 Humble**: The core robotics framework with cross-platform support
- **Docker**: Containerized environment for consistent deployment
- **Artificial Intelligence**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, OpenCV for computer vision and machine learning
- **Physics Engines**: Integration with Gazebo, Unity, and Unreal Engine
- **Cross-Platform**: Native support for Windows 10/11 and macOS

## Development Workflow

### Setting Up Your Development Environment

1. **Open VS Code in the project directory**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

2. **Open the integrated terminal** (Ctrl+` or Cmd+`)

3. **Start the Docker environment**
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

4. **Attach VS Code to the container** (using the Docker extension)

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build all packages
./scripts/build.sh

# Run a specific simulation
ros2 launch simulation gazebo_drone.launch.py

# Run tests
./scripts/test.sh
```

## AI Model Integration

### Loading AI Models
```python
from constellation_overwatch.ai import ComputerVisionInterface

# Initialize computer vision model
cv_model = ComputerVisionInterface("object_detector")
await cv_model.load_model("models/yolo_v5.onnx", config)

# Run inference
detections = await cv_model.detect_objects(image)
```

### Training Custom Models
```bash
# Train a custom model
python sdk/ai/tools/train_model.py --config config/ai_models/custom_detector.yaml

# Deploy trained model
python sdk/ai/tools/deploy_model.py --model trained_models/custom_detector.pth
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Docker Desktop not starting:**
- Ensure virtualization is enabled in BIOS
- On Windows, ensure WSL2 is properly installed
- Restart Docker Desktop service

**ROS 2 commands not found:**
- Ensure you're inside the Docker container
- Source the ROS 2 setup: `source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash`

**Build failures:**
- Check Docker container logs: `docker-compose logs ros-dev`
- Ensure all dependencies are installed in the container

**Performance issues:**
- Allocate more resources to Docker Desktop
- Close unnecessary applications
- Consider using GPU acceleration for AI workloads
