# Historical Project Milestones

This directory contains historical milestone documentation that has been consolidated into the main project status tracking system.

## Archived Milestone Files

- **.ci_improvements_complete** → CI/CD improvements documented in ISSUES_LOG.md

## Current Status Tracking

For current project status, version information, and development progress, see:

- **[STATUS.md](../../STATUS.md)** - Current development status and health metrics
- **[CHANGELOG.md](../../CHANGELOG.md)** - Version history and release notes  
- **[ISSUES_LOG.md](../../ISSUES_LOG.md)** - Issues tracking and action items
- **[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/constellation-overwatch/constellation-overwatch/releases)** - Official version releases

## Documentation Standards

This consolidation follows open source best practices observed in major projects:
- **Node.js**: Standardized release management via GitHub
- **React**: Clean separation of current status vs. historical milestones
- **Kubernetes**: Comprehensive changelog directory structure
- **TensorFlow**: Professional status badges and metrics tracking
- **VS Code**: Wiki-based roadmap and iteration planning
