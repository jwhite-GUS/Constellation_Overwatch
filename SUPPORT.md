## Self-Service Resources

### Quick Start Guide
1. **Installation**: Follow `docs/setup/development-setup.md`
2. **Basic Example**: Run `examples/basic-drone/main.py`
3. **API Usage**: Review `examples/functional-core/demo.py`
4. **Web Interface**: Open `web/dashboard.html`

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Docker Container Issues
**Problem**: Docker container fails to start
**Solution**: 
1. Ensure Docker is running
2. Check available disk space
3. Verify network connectivity
4. Review Docker logs: `docker logs <container_name>`

#### API Connection Issues
**Problem**: Cannot connect to REST API
**Solution**:
1. Verify the API server is running
2. Check the port configuration (default: 8000)
3. Ensure firewall settings allow connections
4. Review API server logs

#### AI Model Loading Issues
**Problem**: AI models fail to load
**Solution**:
1. Verify model files are present in `models/` directory
2. Check GPU availability if using GPU acceleration
3. Ensure sufficient memory is available
4. Review model configuration files

#### WebSocket Connection Issues
**Problem**: Web dashboard not updating in real-time
**Solution**:
1. Check browser console for WebSocket errors
2. Verify WebSocket endpoint URL
3. Check browser WebSocket support
4. Review network proxy settings

### Development Environment Setup

#### Prerequisites
- **Docker**: Version 20.10 or later
- **Python**: Version 3.8 or later
- **Git**: Latest version
- **VS Code**: Recommended IDE

#### Quick Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/constellation-overwatch/constellation-overwatch.git
cd constellation-overwatch

# Build development environment
docker-compose up constellation-dev

# Run basic example
python examples/basic-drone/main.py
```

### Debugging Tips

#### Enable Debug Logging
```python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
```

#### Check System Status
```python
from sdk.core.entity_manager import EntityManager
from sdk.core.message_bus import MessageBus

# Verify core systems
entity_manager = EntityManager()
message_bus = MessageBus()

# Check entity count
print(f"Entities: {len(entity_manager.entities)}")

# Check message bus status
print(f"Subscribers: {len(message_bus._subscribers)}")
```

#### Performance Monitoring
```python
import time
import psutil

# Monitor system resources
cpu_percent = psutil.cpu_percent()
memory_info = psutil.virtual_memory()
print(f"CPU: {cpu_percent}%, Memory: {memory_info.percent}%")
```
