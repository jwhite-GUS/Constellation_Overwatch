## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The Constellation Overwatch SDK team takes security seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

**DO NOT** report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing [security@constellation-overwatch.org](mailto:security@constellation-overwatch.org).

Include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- Location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of report receipt
- **Investigation**: Complete investigation within 5 business days
- **Resolution**: Critical vulnerabilities addressed within 10 business days
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

## Supported Versions

Security updates are provided for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.0.x   | :white_check_mark: |
| < 1.0   | :x:                |

## Security Considerations

### Development Environment
- **Container Security**: Docker containers run with minimal privileges
- **Dependency Management**: Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Code Quality**: Static analysis tools integrated in CI/CD pipeline

### AI Model Security
- **Model Validation**: All AI models undergo security validation before deployment
- **Input Sanitization**: All AI model inputs are sanitized and validated
- **Model Integrity**: Cryptographic verification of model files
- **Training Data**: Secure handling and storage of training datasets

### Communication Security
- **Message Bus**: All inter-component communication can be encrypted
- **REST API**: HTTPS enforced for all API communications
- **WebSocket**: Secure WebSocket connections (WSS) supported
- **Authentication**: Strong authentication mechanisms for all interfaces

### Deployment Security
- **Container Hardening**: Production containers follow security best practices
- **Network Isolation**: Network segmentation and access controls
- **Secret Management**: Secure secret storage and rotation capabilities
- **Monitoring**: Security event logging and monitoring

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors
1. **Code Review**: All code changes require security-focused review
2. **Dependency Updates**: Keep dependencies updated to latest secure versions
3. **Secret Handling**: Never commit secrets, API keys, or credentials
4. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
5. **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information in error messages

### For Deployments
1. **Least Privilege**: Run all components with minimal required privileges
2. **Network Security**: Implement proper network segmentation and firewalls
3. **Access Control**: Strong authentication and authorization mechanisms
4. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive security monitoring and alerting
5. **Backup Security**: Secure backup and recovery procedures

## Known Security Considerations

### Current Limitations
- **Authentication**: Basic authentication implementation requires enhancement for production
- **Encryption**: End-to-end encryption not fully implemented across all components
- **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit logging system in development
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control system planned for future release

### Planned Security Enhancements
- **Multi-factor Authentication**: Implementation planned for v1.1.0
- **End-to-end Encryption**: Full encryption support planned for v1.2.0
- **Audit Framework**: Comprehensive audit logging planned for v1.1.0
- **Penetration Testing**: External security assessment planned quarterly

## Compliance and Standards

### Government Requirements
- **FISMA Compliance**: Architecture designed for FISMA compliance
- **FedRAMP Ready**: Preparing for FedRAMP authorization process
- **NIST Framework**: Following NIST Cybersecurity Framework guidelines
- **STIG Compliance**: Security Technical Implementation Guide compliance

### Industry Standards
- **ISO 27001**: Information security management system alignment
- **OWASP**: Following OWASP security guidelines and best practices
- **CIS Controls**: Implementation of CIS Critical Security Controls
- **SANS Top 25**: Protection against SANS Top 25 software errors

## Security Resources
