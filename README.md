<!-- COPILOT: This is the primary project documentation viewed by all users and contributors -->

**Government-Owned, Community-Driven Autonomous Systems Integration Platform**

Constellation Overwatch is a modular open systems architecture (MOSA) autonomy and integration stack designed to support distributed command and control of autonomous systems, sensors, and payloads. This SDK provides a common, open-source development environment enabling rapid, secure integration of heterogeneous unmanned systems and payloads into a unified operational picture.

## Project Overview

Constellation Overwatch differentiates itself through its completely open, non-proprietary licensing and ecosystem-driven development model. Leveraging existing government-owned solutions such as the Team Awareness Kit (TAK), this platform enables real-time data fusion, collaborative autonomy, multi-domain sensor integration, and intuitive common operating picture (COP) visualization—without restrictive per-seat licenses or proprietary integration barriers.

**Functionally analogous to**: Anduril's Lattice, Collins Aerospace's RapidEdge, Boeing's collaborative autonomy systems, and commercial industry Pixhawk standards, but with complete open-source accessibility.

## Key Attributes

### Open Architecture Integration
- Rapid "plug-and-play" capability for any MOSA-compliant autonomous platform, payload, or sensor
- Standardized interfaces and communication protocols
- Hardware-agnostic design supporting diverse unmanned systems

### Continuous ATO & Secure DevSecOps Environment
- Government-owned sandbox for rapid, secure innovation and deployment
- Containerized development environment with security best practices
- Automated testing and continuous integration pipelines

### Collaborative Autonomy & Distributed AI
- Real-time tasking and mission autonomy across diverse unmanned platforms
- Multi-domain sensor fusion and data processing
- Distributed decision-making capabilities with machine learning integration
- Computer vision, natural language processing, and reinforcement learning support

### Ecosystem-Driven Development
- Community-contributed capabilities and plugins accelerate adoption
- Modular architecture enabling rapid capability integration
- Reduced development costs through shared resources

### Common Operational Picture (COP) Integration
- Seamless compatibility with existing government COP frameworks (e.g., TAK)
- Real-time data visualization and situational awareness
- Interoperable with existing military command and control systems

## Mission Impact

With new mandates for mass-proliferation of US-made commoditized sUAS, Constellation Overwatch allows government and industry partners to quickly integrate capabilities into operationally relevant scenarios, maximizing innovation and interoperability while eliminating proprietary licensing lock-in. More importantly, it gets UXS tools into the hands of warfighters directly by decentralizing the integration of useful robotics devices into common portable unit-level kits.
