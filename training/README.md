# AI Model Training Directory

This directory contains training scripts, datasets, and model checkpoints for the Constellation Overwatch SDK AI components.

## Directory Structure

```
training/
├── datasets/           # Training datasets
├── scripts/           # Training scripts
├── checkpoints/       # Model checkpoints
├── configs/          # Training configurations
└── logs/             # Training logs
```

## Training Components

### Computer Vision
- Object detection models (YOLO, R-CNN)
- Image classification models (ResNet, EfficientNet)
- Semantic segmentation models (DeepLab, U-Net)

### Decision Making
- Reinforcement learning models
- Rule-based decision trees
- Multi-objective optimization models

### Natural Language Processing
- Command interpretation models
- Response generation models
- Intent classification models

## Usage

1. **Prepare Training Data**: Place datasets in the `datasets/` directory
2. **Configure Training**: Set parameters in `configs/` directory
3. **Run Training**: Execute training scripts from the `scripts/` directory
4. **Monitor Progress**: View logs and checkpoints in respective directories

## Model Export

Trained models should be exported to the `../models/` directory for use in the SDK.

## GPU Requirements

AI training requires NVIDIA GPU with CUDA support. Use the AI training Docker container for optimal performance.
