## Model Formats

- **ONNX**: Cross-platform optimized models (.onnx)
- **TensorFlow**: TensorFlow SavedModel format
- **PyTorch**: PyTorch model files (.pth, .pt)
- **Custom**: SDK-specific model formats

## Model Management

Models are loaded and managed through the AI orchestrator system. Configuration files specify:
- Model paths and formats
- Inference parameters
- Hardware requirements
- Performance characteristics

## Performance Optimization

Models are optimized for:
- Real-time inference on edge devices
- GPU acceleration when available
- Memory efficiency
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Model Updates

Models can be updated through:
1. Training new versions
2. Fine-tuning existing models
3. Downloading pre-trained models
4. Model format conversion

See the training directory for model development workflows.
