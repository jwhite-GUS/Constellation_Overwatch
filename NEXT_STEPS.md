# 🚀 Next Steps for Galaxy Unmanned Systems ROS Project

## What We've Accomplished

✅ **Repository Setup Complete**
- Initialized Git repository with proper structure
- Created comprehensive README.md with team requirements
- Set up cross-platform Docker environment for ROS 2
- Configured VS Code workspace with recommended extensions
- Added development guidelines and contribution standards

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub
```bash
# Create a new repository on GitHub (github.com/your-org/gus-ros-drone-sim)
# Then push your local repository:

git remote add origin https://github.com/your-org/gus-ros-drone-sim.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### 2. Install Required Software on Team Machines

**For Windows Users:**
- Docker Desktop: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/install/
- VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Git: https://git-scm.com/download/win

**For macOS Users:**
- Docker Desktop: https://docs.docker.com/desktop/mac/install/
- VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/
- Git: `brew install git` or https://git-scm.com/download/mac

### 3. Team Onboarding

Each team member should:
1. Clone the repository
2. Follow `docs/setup/development-setup.md`
3. Run the setup script for their platform
4. Verify the environment works

### 4. Development Phases

**Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)**
- [ ] Set up basic ROS 2 packages structure
- [ ] Create drone control interface package
- [ ] Set up Gazebo simulation environment
- [ ] Test Docker environment on both Windows and macOS

**Phase 2: Core Functionality (Week 3-4)**
- [ ] Implement basic drone controller
- [ ] Create simulation worlds
- [ ] Add MAVROS integration for drone communication
- [ ] Implement basic flight modes

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Week 5-6)**
- [ ] Unity integration setup
- [ ] Unreal Engine integration
- [ ] Advanced simulation scenarios
- [ ] Performance optimization

**Phase 4: Testing & Documentation (Week 7-8)**
- [ ] Comprehensive testing
- [ ] Documentation completion
- [ ] Team training materials
- [ ] Deployment procedures

## Team Workflow

### Daily Development
1. **Pull latest changes**: `git pull origin main`
2. **Create feature branch**: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3. **Develop in Docker container**: `docker-compose exec ros-dev bash`
4. **Test changes**: `./scripts/build.sh`
5. **Commit and push**: Follow CONTRIBUTING.md guidelines

### Weekly Sync
- Review progress on GitHub Projects/Issues
- Discuss any cross-platform issues
- Share knowledge and troubleshooting tips
- Plan next week's development

## Important Considerations

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Always test on both Windows and macOS
- Use Docker for consistent environment
- Avoid platform-specific file paths in code
- Test with different Docker Desktop versions

### Performance
- Monitor Docker resource usage
- Optimize container sizes
- Consider using multi-stage Docker builds
- Profile simulation performance

### Security
- Don't commit sensitive information
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Keep Docker images updated
- Follow security best practices
